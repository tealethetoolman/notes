# asteroid mining

## Asteroids have mass
- carbon based asteroids
- silicon based asteroids
- metallic asteroids
- asteroids may be just lumps of rocks loosely held together

# materials
- platinum
- gold
- iron
- water


# networks of travel
- water being used for propulsion systems. if asteroids are found with water, refuel depots could make the travel network easier.
- space stations

## questions
- how to mine an asteroid
-- automated mining techniques
-- manual mining techniques


-- laser miners
--- the heat would make materials melt and clump together
--- extraction?
-- mining in low or no gravity
--- a system that grabs the ground and does the mining

## laws
-- laws on materials mined
-- laws on taxing

## who is doing this
- companies
- china
- japan
- us
- jeff bezos
- ~~elon musk~~ (claims to be against it)
- transastra
-- sunlight miners
-- sunflower power systems
-- turns rock into vapors and collects
-- asteroid capture system

## missions

- osiris x
- jaxa hayubusa 2

## phases of operation
- recon
-- go and find some asteroids
--- do spectography
-- build probes
-- send probes to asteroids
-- get cbetter recon and find landing sites
-- need to grab a core sample since surface and under may be diff
