# ANSIBLE for WINNERS

give some information about ansible
- what is ansible?
![redhat literature on ansible](ansible-fig1.PNG)
-- A solution to solve automation of systems at scale. Ansible is a simple and powerful Automation engine. With the power to leverage groupings, you can run repeatable, autidable, and easy to source tasks at scale. The "at scale" part is important. Asnible is a command line tool and you need something like Jenkins or some other web wrapper to make your jobs click-n-go. Or you can spend 5 figures or more a year on Tower. 
- Deisgn Principles
-- Have a dead-simple setup process with a minimal learning curve.
-- Manage machines very quickly and in parallel.
-- Avoid custom-agents and additional open ports, be agentless by leveraging the existing SSH daemon.
-- Describe infrastructure in a language that is both machine and human friendly.
-- Focus on security and easy auditability/review/rewriting of content.
-- Manage new remote machines instantly, without bootstrapping any software.
-- Allow module development in any dynamic language, not just Python.
-- Be usable as non-root.
-- Be the easiest IT automation system to use, ever.
